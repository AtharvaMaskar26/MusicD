# dMusic
* A decentralized application which allows music collaborators to split royalties from a song without having to rely on a central platform like DistroKid, Ditto or Amuse.
* Limited ERC721 functionalities like the transferFrom fucntions to stop external calls to the function and it messing with the logic of the main contract. 
* Use this in your application at your own discretion. Contract though heavily tested and statically analyzed, hasn't been put through a thorough audit.
